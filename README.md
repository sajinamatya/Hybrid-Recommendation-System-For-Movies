# Hybrid Movie Recommendation system 
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning : Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and normalize relevant data fields.
Collaborative Filtering Implementation : Implement matrix factorization (e.g., SVD) for collaborative filtering using a user-item interaction matrix.
Content-Based Filtering Implementation : Build a content-based filtering system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
Hybrid System Integration (2 Points): Combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering results to form a hybrid recommendation system.
